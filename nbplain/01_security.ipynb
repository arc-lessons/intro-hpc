    "\n",
    "HPC resources, as well many services you will use, are shared resources.  They are used by many researchers studying a wide range of problems.  Any issues arising from the actions of one individual's actions can therefore impact many of your colleagues and result in resources being taken offline whilst issues are investigated and remedied.  Furthermore they are expensive resources typically run by small or modest sized teams so impacts, whilst hopefully rare, can be costly in time and personpower.  This is before we consider the potential loss of data or breaches of sensititve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users and system operators have a shared responsibility to ensure the security of resources.  System operators monitor the system, ensure security patches are up-to-date and that the systems is configured to restrict access correctly e.g. so that users cannot see each others data/files by default.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Users should follow best practice to mitigate the risk of accounts and access details being compromised, e.g. we all know that we must keep our passwords secret.  You shouldn't make your files accessible to others unless necessary.  This episode specifically addresses how we can use `ssh` and associated tools to securely access remote resources and mitigate potential security issues."

    "As HPC services are remote machines, interaction is done over an encrypted communication channel called Secure Shell version 2 (SSH-2). This allows command-line access to one of the login nodes of a HPC service, from which you can run commands or use a command-line text editor to edit files. `ssh` can also be used to run graphical programs such as GUI text editors and debuggers when used in conjunction with an X client."

A strong password consists of at least six characters (and the more characters, the stronger the password) that are a combination of letters, numbers and symbols (@, #, $, %, etc.) if allowed. Passwords are typically case-sensitive, so a strong password contains letters in both uppercase and lowercase. Strong passwords also do not contain words that can be found in a dictionary or parts of the user's own name.\n",

You keep the private part of the key secure on your local machine protected with a passphrase.\n",

There are a number of methods the most common being [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) which uses prime numbers.  If you are going to use this you should use a key size of at least 2048 and preferably 4096.  Public keys can be broken with brute force computation and the longer the key the more secure it is.\n",
